		<h2>Call of Duty - Black Ops 2</h2>
		<p>Black Ops 2 was definitely one of my favorite games to play when I was younger and I made a lot of good memories playing it with my friends. We used to play a variety of game modes such as Zombies and Multiplayer. Zombies was my favorite game mode to play with my friends and our favorite map was definitely Town.</p>
